# Points Demo Application
This repository contains a simple Java application that demonstrates a basic points management domain. 
It is implemented using Spring Boot and includes domain models, repositories, and unit/integration tests. 
Currently, there is no main application or REST interface implemented - only the core domain logic and tests 
are available at present.

---

# Overview
The application is designed to manage "points" for accounts. It supports:

- **Account Creation:**  
  Accounts have a name and a balance. The default balance is 0 unless otherwise specified.

- **Spending Points:**  
  A service method allows points to be spent from an account, with validations to prevent spending more than the 
  available balance. An exception (`InsufficientPointsException`) is thrown if an attempt is made to spend too 
  many points.

- **Idempotency:**  
  There is a stub for idempotency keys handling (an `IdempotencyKeyRepository` is present but commented out in 
  the tests). This suggests that future work may include ensuring operations are idempotent.

The provided unit tests in `PointsManagementIntegrationTests` cover:
- Spending points under valid conditions.
- Handling an attempt to spend more points than available.
- Basic CRUD operations on the `Accounts` entity.

## Technologies and Frameworks
- **Java 8+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**
- **MySQL (or compatible) for persistence**  
  The provided DDL is compatible with MySQL using InnoDB.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
- **Maven** for dependency management and building the project.
- **MySQL Database:**  
  Use the provided DDL to create the necessary tables. Alternatively, you can configure an in-memory 
  database for testing purposes.

### Database Schema

The application uses two tables: `accounts` and `idempotency_keys`.

**DDL for `accounts`:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE `accounts` (
  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `account` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `balance` bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=57 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

**DDL for `idempotency_keys`:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE `idempotency_keys` (
  `IDMP_ID` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `idempotency_key` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `account_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `createdtime` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`IDMP_ID`),
  UNIQUE KEY `idempotency_key` (`idempotency_key`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=17 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

Ensure these tables are available in your database, and update the application's database configuration as needed.

## Configuration

This application uses Spring Bootâ€™s externalized configuration to manage sensitive data. Sensitive information, such as database credentials, should not be hard-coded in the source code. Instead, they are injected using environment variables.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

For example, the database username and password are configured via the `POINTS_DB_USERNAME` and `POINTS_DB_PASSWORD` environment variables. In your `application.properties` file, you'll find the following configuration:

```properties
spring.datasource.password=${POINTS_DB_USERNAME:defaultUsername}
spring.datasource.password=${POINTS_DB_PASSWORD:defaultPassword}
```

- **POINTS_DB_USERNAME:**  
  Set this environment variable to the actual database username when running the application.  
  *Example (Linux/Mac):*
  ```bash
  export POINTS_DB_USERNAME=your_secure_db_username
  ```
  *Example (Windows CMD):*
  ```cmd
  set POINTS_DB_USERNAME=your_secure_db_username
  ```

  - **Default Value:**  
  A default value (`defaultUsername`) is provided for development purposes. It is strongly recommended to override this in production.

- **POINTS_DB_PASSWORD:**  
  Set this environment variable to the actual database password when running the application.  
  *Example (Linux/Mac):*
  ```bash
  export POINTS_DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_db_password
  ```
  *Example (Windows CMD):*
  ```cmd
  set POINTS_DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_db_password
  ```

  - **Default Value:**  
  A default value (`defaultPassword`) is provided for development purposes. It is strongly recommended to override this in production.

### Running the Application

Make sure to set the necessary environment variables before starting the application. For example:

```bash
export DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_db_password
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, if you are using Docker, you can pass the environment variable via your Docker configuration.

## Running the Tests

The project includes integration tests located in `PointsManagementIntegrationTests`. These tests:
- Set up two accounts (one with an initial balance and one with a zero balance).
- Validate that spending points behaves as expected (both valid spending and attempts to overspend).
- Clean up the test data after each test run.

To run the tests, execute:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will compile the project and run the tests using Maven.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Main Application & REST Interface:**  
  A REST interface will be added to expose endpoints for account management and points operations.

- **Idempotency Handling:**  
  Further work on idempotency key management will ensure that duplicate operations are handled gracefully.

- **Enhanced Business Logic:**  
  Additional business rules and error handling may be implemented as the application evolves.

- **Integration with External Systems:**  
  Consider integration with messaging systems or other services as needed.
